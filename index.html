    <h2>About Operation Smile</h2>

    <p>Every three minutes a child is born with a celft lip. The children who survive are often unable to eat, speak, socialize or smile. And in too many cases, their parents can't afford to give them the surgeries they need to live a productive life. <strong>Our goal is to fundraise and provide Operation Smile with funds to provide these children with a smile. </strong></p>

    <h2>Why We Exist</h2>

    <p> We dream of a world where no child suffers from lack of access to safe surgery. Learn why we do what we do in the video below. </p>

    <h2>How the University of Minnesota Helps </h2>

    <p>As Operation Smile UMN, we will coordinate fundraising events for the Operation Smile program. All the money raised will be directly donated to the program and used in order to fund oral surgeries of underprivileged children around the world. Every child deserves a healthy and beautiful smile.</p>

    <p> </p>

    <h2>Get Involved</h2>

    <p>We encourage anyone that is interested to participate. We will have meetings twice a month (location and time TBD). Please contact Meghan Goodman at goodm170@umn.edu for additional information. If you are unable to join the club, please consider donating. </p>
